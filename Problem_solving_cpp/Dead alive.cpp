/*
In Japan, there was a very huge Tsunami. Millions and millions worth of
buildings and property were destroyed. Many people lost their lives while
some of them were injured and few were safe. A news reporter arrives at
the spot to take the current survey regarding the situation of the people
alive, dead and injured. He wanted to publish it in the newspaper and reach
out to other countries asking to help the affected people. Can you please
help him in this noble cause by writing a program to generate the
newspaper report?
